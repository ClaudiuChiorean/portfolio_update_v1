                <h2>Calisthenics</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Calisthenics or callisthenics</strong> is a <strong>form of strength training</strong>
                    consisting of a variety of movements that exercise large muscle groups,
                    such as standing, grasping, pushing, etc. Calisthenics training is really good for building muscle,
                    especially in your upper body and core. This is because it combines load (your bodyweight) with
                    movement
                    against gravity.

                <h2>Reading </h2>
                <p>Reading is good for you because it improves your focus, memory, empathy, and communication skills. It
                    can
                    reduce stress, improve your mental health, and help you live longer. Reading also allows you to
                    learn
                    new things to help you succeed in your work and relationships.</p>

                <h2>Hiking </h2>
                <p>Hiking is a long, vigorous walk, usually on trails or footpaths in the countryside. Walking for
                    pleasure
                    developed in Europe during the eighteenth century. Religious pilgrimages have existed much longer
                    but
                    they involve walking long distances for a spiritual purpose associated with specific religions.</p>
